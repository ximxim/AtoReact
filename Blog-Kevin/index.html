        <p>
            <a href='#'>Stellaris</a> is a <em>real-time</em> grand strategy game set in space, beginning in the year 2200. Players take control of a species in its early stages of interstellar space exploration, right after the invention of <em>faster-than-light (FTL)</em> spaceship technology, ready to claim a place as one of "the species of the stars". Depending on several factors, such as the ethics of the civilization and the player's desires, the ultimate goal of the empire can range from galactic conquest, hoarding of resources and technological supremacy, to peaceful coexistence with or absolute destruction of all other sentient life. The player controls ships, including science, construction and military vessels. Combat includes space combat and ground combat and is more centered towards the bigger picture, preparation, and strategy. There are also diplomatic options such as alliances and trade agreements with other races.

            The game begins either by picking one of the premade empires or using a <em>player-made</em> customized empire/species. The process of creating involves several different choices. The first of these choices involves picking a mixture of <em>positive and negative characteristics ("Traits")</em> that make up their species. Next, the player customizes the empire of their species. In this phase the player chooses the <em>ethics and civics</em> of their empire (with Ethics and Civics points, respectively) which are meant to represent the ideology the empire has adopted and they can give various buffs, restrict certain features (a Spiritualist empire cannot use robots and dismantles them upon acquiring a planet that contains them, a Materialistic empire cannot outlaw robots) and governments from being picked (an Authoritarian empire is unable to be a democratic government and vice versa), and change the way information is presented to the player.[2] Players also choose an origin, a kind of backstory for their empire. Origins can include originating from a world ravaged by nuclear warfare or starting with a secondary playable race, such as robots or a strong but unintelligent worker race. These secondary species are created in a similar process as previously mentioned.
