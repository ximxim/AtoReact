        <p><em>Rick</em> and <em>Morty</em> is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by <em>Justin Roiland</em> and <em>Dan Harmon</em> for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block <a href="#">Adult Swim</a>. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist <em>Rick Sanchez</em> and his good-hearted but fretful grandson <em>Morty Smith</em>, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.</p>
        <p><em>Roiland</em> voices the eponymous characters, with <em>Chris Parnell</em>, <em>Spencer Grammer</em> and <em>Sarah Chalke</em> voicing the rest of the family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future, created by <em>Roiland</em> for <a href="#">Channel 101</a>, a short film festival co-founded by <em>Harmon</em>. The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.</p>
